# What is it?
This is a .NET Windows application to semi-automate creating a SSL certificate using the gethttpsforfree.com website. 
The application is open-source and you're more than welcome to take a peak. 

_I must warn you though, it was created very quickly and the code is quite "WinForms"-ie ;)_

# How does it work?
Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/CzbZKrYo7HA" target="_blank">youtube demonstration video</a> that shows the entire process of creating a certificate from scratch. It takes only 4 minutes!

# How do I get it?
Download the exe directly fromn the release folder. 
It is that simple.
